# Aur_Packages

This my PKGBUILD for now:

Aur link: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/lenovolegionlinux-git

legion-fan-utils-linux: https://github.com/Petingoso legion-fan-utils-linux

# Credits:
Thanks for @Petingoso and @johnfanv2 for creating the packages.

# Notes:
If the packages get deleted from the aur for some reason I will use this repo as backup (Its my frist time publishing a package for the aur but I think I dindâ€™t break the guidelines).

This pkgbuild and package have no warranty use at your wrong risk.
